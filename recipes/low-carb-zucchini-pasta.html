        <p>Zucchini noodles for keto and low-carb diets are much more similar to spaghetti than spaghetti squash. If you're a pasta lover and need a low-carb version, try this quick and versatile recipe for one. Serve with your favorite sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 zucchini, peeled</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup water</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
            Use a vegetable peeler to cut long, wide strips down one side of one zucchini until you reach the seeds. Turn zucchini and repeat on three remaining sides. Repeat with remaining zucchini. Discard zucchini cores.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
            Stack zucchini strips on top of each other, then cut thin strips lengthwise along the stack; strips will resemble spaghetti noodles.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Step 3</strong><br>
            Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini "noodles" and cook for 1 minute. Add water and continue to cook until zucchini is softened and water has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
