        <p>This is a great low-carb alternative to your standard homemade tacos. I love Mexican food and wasn't willing to part with tacos after starting my low-carb diet. This always satisfies my craving.</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>½ (4 ounce) can diced jalapeno peppers</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup salsa</li>
            <li>¼ cup low-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
            Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and jalapeno peppers together in a skillet over medium-high heat until meat is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir taco seasoning into meat mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.

            <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
            Stir meat mixture, shredded lettuce, tomato, Cheddar cheese, salsa, and sour cream together in a large bowl. Divide taco mixture among 4 bowls and top each with avocado slices.
