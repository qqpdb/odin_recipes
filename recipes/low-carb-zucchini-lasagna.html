            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ul class="steps">
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking pan.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <li>
                    Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt; set aside to drain in a colander.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <li>
                    To prepare the meat sauce, cook ground beef and black pepper in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer pink.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <li>
                    Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, basil, and oregano; add a small amount of hot water if sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, stir ricotta, egg, and parsley together in a bowl until well combined.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <li>
                    To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, all of the spinach, followed by all of the mushrooms, then 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering in the remaining meat sauce, zucchini slices, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Spread Parmesan evenly over the top; cover with foil.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 7</h3>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes.
                </li>
                
                <h3>Step 8</h3>
                <li>
                    Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.
                </li>
            </ul>
